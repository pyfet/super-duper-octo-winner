## Setup
### Requirements:
python >= 3.5

#### Creating a virtual Environment:

1. To create the virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
1. To activate venv `source venv/bin/activate`
1. Install project dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. To run the main file file with video capture: `python src/main.py`

Once done, you can shutdown your virtual environment by:
    `deactivate`
